  \frametitle{Feature selection}
  %% \framesubtitle{}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Many published models use \h{feature selection} to reduce\\
    the size of a term-term DSM matrix%
    \pause
  \item Selection criteria:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item most frequent context terms
    \item most informative contxt terms (tf.idf)
    \item most discriminative context terms (variance, entropy)
    \item term restricted by part of speech (e.g.\ only verbs)
    \end{itemize}
    \pause
  \item Features often selected \emph{before} co-occurrence counts
    \begin{itemize}
    \item only a moderately-sized DSM matrix has to be built
    \item allows simple in-memory algorithm for co-occurrence counts
    \end{itemize}
    \pause
  \item Alternative: build DSM matrix only for relevant target terms
    \begin{itemize}
    \item i.e.\ reduce the number of rows instead of number of columns
    \end{itemize}
    \pause
  \item \hh{Disadvantage}: useful information may be discarded
    \begin{itemize}
    \item aggressive feature selection is common in the DSM literature
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
