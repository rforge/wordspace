Version 0.2:
  - this release fixes several bugs in the underlying 3rd-party SVDLIBC code, which produce incorrect results or get stuck in infinite loops for highly sparse matrices that require multiple restarts of the Lanczos iteration; various corner cases including small diagonal matrices were also affected
  - a faulty RNG implementation in SVDLIBC contributed to triggering these bugs (but was not the root cause); the RNG has also been fixed
  - original bug report from Abdelmoneim Desouki <desouki@hhu.de>

Version 0.1-4:
  - for some inexplicable reason, R on Oracle Solaris 10 (i386) doesn't like C functions named "store", leading to a segmentation fault and test failures on CRAN
  - function store() has been renamed store_vec() in the 3rd-party C code included in the package

Version 0.1-3:
  - added native routine registration to comply with new CRAN requirements

Version 0.1-2:
  - stress tests with large number of random sparse nonnegative matrices
  - fix some typos in documentation

Version 0.1-1:
  - fix ISO C incompatibilities that prevented compilation on some platforms
  - more detailed copyright information in DESCRIPTION and LICENSE

Version 0.1:
  - initial release
  - based on SVDLIBC version 1.4
  - modified to avoid I/O on STDOUT and STDERR
