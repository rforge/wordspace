Changes in version 0.1-0

  - this will be the first usable release with a hopefully stable basic API

Pre-release milestones

  - v0.21: experimental support for OpenMP on appropriate platforms
    - results unsatisfactory so far
    - slower than serial code on Linux (Ubuntu 12.04), showing no more than 100% CPU
    - n/a on Mac OS X in the default R installation (but achieves speed-up if expressly activated)
