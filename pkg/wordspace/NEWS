Changes in version 0.1-0

  - this will be the first usable release with a hopefully stable basic API

Pre-release milestones

  - v0.21: experimental support for OpenMP on appropriate platforms
    - n/a on Mac OS X in the default R installation (but achieves speed-up if expressly activated)
    - parallelization only used if more than 100 M operations have to be carried out (purely heuristic limit)
    - first experiments suggests that using more than 4 or 8 threads brings little benefit with enormous overhead
    - setting OMP_NUM_THREADS is strongly recommended but may also affect BLAS matrix operations (e.g. with OpenBLAS)

  - v0.23: further performance improvements
    - dist.matrix() uses less memory and is considerably faster for cosine/angle distance measure
    - new function pair.distances() computes distances or neighbour ranks for a list of word pairs efficiently
    - nearest.neighbours() automatically processes a long list of lookup terms in moderately sized batches

  - v0.24: OpenMP no longer activated by default
    - wordspace.openmp() to check for OpenMP support and select the number of parallel threads
