TODO:

  - remove dsm.score.old, rowNorms.old, normalize.rows.old, ... (NAMESPACE, R/...) when new C implementation has been tested sufficiently
  - write complete (rough) documentation for basic functions
  - efficient reimplementation of rbind.dsm for sparse matrices (require all arguments to be sparse in normal form; use C code, work with triplet representation, or very clever code on dgCMatrix objects)
  - implement all=TRUE option for merge.dsm ("expanding merge")
  - implement cbind.dsm
  - implement column merge (rows=FALSE) for merge.dsm
  - implement in-place row and column scaling in C (dense matrix only) to conserve memory in cosine distance measure (worthwhile?)
  - replace as.double(), as.integer() in .C() calls by functions that check whether argument already is a double/int vector or matrix and pass through without dropping attributes etc. in this case (to keep R's pseudo-refcounting from making unnecessary copies in some cases)
  - include more small data sets for usage examples
  - add usage examples to all functions

RECENT CHANGES to the 'wordspace' package:

  - 

Version 0.1-0

  - this will be the first usable release with a hopefully stable basic API
