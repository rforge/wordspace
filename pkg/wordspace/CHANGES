TODO:

  - reimplement rowNorms in C (mainly for memory-efficiency)
  - old versions -> rowNorms.old, normalize.rows.old should be used by dsm.score.old for comparison
  - test performance and memory-efficiency of C implementation against dsm.score.old
  - implement dist.matrix in C, benchmarking different approaches
  - replace as.double(), as.integer() in .C() calls by functions that check whether argument already is a double/int vector or matrix and pass through without dropping attributes etc. in this case (to keep R's pseudo-refcounting from making unnecessary copies)
  - remove dsm.score.old, rowNorms.old, normalize.rows.old, ... (NAMESPACE, R/...) when new C implementation has been tested sufficiently
  - write complete documentation for basic functions
  - include more small data sets for usage examples
  - add usage examples to all functions

RECENT CHANGES to the 'wordspace' package:

  - 

Version 0.1-0

  - this will be the first usable release with a hopefully stable basic API
